                The innovation idea should enable the Authority to benefit maximum from the available 
                resources in exchange for the best-outsourced products and services hence getting value 
                for money.

                Value for Money is a core principle that guides the KeNHA innovation ecosystem. It 
                emphasizes the importance of optimizing resources, both financial and non-financial, to 
                achieve the highest possible returns on investments. This principle goes beyond 
                cost-cutting measures; it focuses on making well-informed decisions that ensure the best 
                use of resources while delivering top-quality products and services.

                Innovation deas that align with the Value for Money principle not only contribute to cost 
                savings but also foster efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainable growth. By continually 
                seeking innovative solutions that enhance the value derived from every investment, KeNHA 
                aims to set new standards in delivering impactful results within the constraints of 
                available resources. This approach ensures that the Authority remains at the forefront of 
                innovation and best practices, all while delivering optimal outcomes that benefit both the 
                organization and the public at large.
