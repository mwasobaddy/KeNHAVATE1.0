                revenue streams within its existing assets and operations. By leveraging 
                advanced data analytics and market insights, the solution should provide 
                actionable intelligence on underutilized resources that can be

                contributing to the sustainability of infrastructure projects and 
                services. Through effective revenue generation, the Authority can 
                strengthen its financial resilience and further enhance its ability to 
                serve the public.
